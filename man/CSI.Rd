\usage{
CSI(
  b.source,
  from = NULL,
  to = NULL,
  behaviours = NULL,
  ot.source = NULL,
  ot.type = "table",
  duration.NA.treatm = "omit"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{b.source}{data frame with behavioural data}

\item{from}{character or date in format YYYY-MM-DD, by default the earliest and latest date in \code{b.source}, respectively}

\item{to}{character or date in format YYYY-MM-DD, by default the earliest and latest date in \code{b.source}, respectively}

\item{behaviours}{character string with codes of behaviours to be considered, by default all behaviours that occur in the data are considered. Can also be a named list if merging of different codes into broader categories is desired (see details).}

\item{ot.source}{data frame with observation time data}

\item{ot.type}{character: \code{"table"} (OT for each ID, separated by date). "party"-style not supported!}

\item{duration.NA.treatm}{by default \code{"omit"}, i.e. if there is a duration column in \code{behav.source} and not all data points have a duration (i.e. NA) for a given behaviour (e.g. grooming), these NA data points will be deleted; alternatively \code{"count"}, i.e. behaviours for which not all durations are given will be transformed into "1", i.e. they will be counted as single occurences (for example, grooming will become "grooming bouts")}
}
\value{
a data.frame with CSI and standardized CSI. For the latter, the rates of behaviours are z-transformed before they are summed and divided by the number of behaviours.
}
\description{
CSI (individual CSI)
}
\details{
Typically, behaviours to be considered are supplied in the form \code{behaviours=c("groom", "approach")}. If you wish to merge behaviours into broader categories, supply a named list, e.g. \code{list(groom=c("grm.received", "grm.given"), greet=c("greet", "mount", "grunt"))}. In such a case, behaviours in a given category are summed first to calculate the rates with which the behaviour categories occur.
